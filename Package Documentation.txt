Documentation for Creating NPM packages

1. We need to install Packages "babel" and "webpack" if not available on typescript template

2. Install npm add -D typescript react react-dom @types/react

3. need to install and put this on package file as explained on this site:
  
  - https://errorsfixing.com/how-to-include-a-css-file-in-react-and-typescript-npm-package/

4. Create 3 files in src folder

  > main.tsx file 
  > css file 
  > index.ts file (here we will export our main.tsx file )
  
5. Write your code for component and add CSS for that component.

6. npm run build 
   - for bundling for all files, it will create dist folder which is our final folder going to be pushed as package
   
7. npm login 
   - for login into npmjs site
   
   it will ask your npmjs login credentials 
   
8. npm publish ./dist

  - here we are publishing our dist folder to site
